/**
 * sshd resolves a user home folder during static initialisation and throws on
 * Android, where there is none. The throw happens inside an initialiser, so the
 * first attempt fails with ExceptionInInitializerError and every later one with
 * NoClassDefFoundError -- and JGit reports the lot as "remote hung up
 * unexpectedly", which describes none of it.
 *
 * A JVM always has a home folder, so this cannot reproduce the failure. What it
 * can do is assert the resolver is actually installed, which is the part that
 * was missing.
